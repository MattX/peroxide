Stuff that needs to be done:

### R5RS compliance

1. Remaining numeric primitives
2. Remaining ports-oriented primitives
3. eval
4. case folding option

### Optimization

1. Hook up GC
2. Make bytecode not-too-stupid
3. Optimize things like values and the size of ValRefs.
4. Primitive inlining
5. Let optimization and other compile-time stuff
