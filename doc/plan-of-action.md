Stuff that needs to be done:

1. Move symbol resolution to the parser stage
2. Properly implement the immutable / global / local distinction
3. Implement apply and eval
4. Figure out what the deal is with syntaxic closures used in lambdas
5. Implement that deal
6. Implement call/cc (oh no)
7. Hook up GC
